# Luau-Utilities
A collection of utilities I find myself writing and reusing on the Roblox platform, although many of them are not intrinsically tied to the platform.

The goal of this collections is to provide simple granular easy to understand functions that can be integrated without hasstle into whatever you're working on. So each should have minimal dependency on any other and are very portable.

I've opted to make the utilities understandable rather than perfectly optimized, which I find is almost always the best long term policy.

Feel free to open an issue to any new utility you'd like! (or just write it yourself and open a pull request!)
