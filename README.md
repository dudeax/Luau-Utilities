# Luau-Utilities
A collection of utilities I find myself writing and reusing on the Roblox platform, although many of them are not intrinsically tied to the platform.

The goal of this collections is to provide simple granular easy to understand functions that can be integrated easily into whatever you're working on. So each should have minimal dependency on any other and should be very portable.

I've opted to make the utilities understandable rather than perfectly optimized, which I find is almost always the best long term policy.
